# Abstract
It is becoming more apparent that there are rich contributions to temporal processing across the brain. Temporal dynamics have been found from lower brain structures all the way to cortical regions. Specifically, in vitro cortical preparations have been extremely useful in understanding how local circuits can time. While many of these results depict vastly different processing than a traditional central clock metaphor they still leave questions as to how this information is integrated. We therefore review evidence to place the results pertaining to local circuit timers into the larger context of temporal perception and generalization.
