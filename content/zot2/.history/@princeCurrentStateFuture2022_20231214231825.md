> [!Excerpt] Abstract
> We provide a brief review of the common assumptions about biological learning with findings from experimental neuroscience and contrast them with the efficiency of gradient-based learning in recurrent neural networks. The key issues discussed in this review include: synaptic plasticity, neural circuits, theory-experiment divide, and objective functions. We conclude with recommendations for both theoretical and experimental neuroscientists when designing new studies that could help bring clarity to these issues.

# Extracted Annotations and Comments
It’s well established that some connectivity motifs and microcircuits are conserved across species and individuals (e.g., neocortical columns, the hippocampal-entorhinal formation, cortico-cerebellar loops, and striatal networks). Furthermore, a certain degree of functional specialization consistently emerges across brain regions in terms of hierarchies within visual, somatosensory, motor, or auditory cortices. This degree of conservation indicates that much of the information required to generate these architectures are stored genetically, as a consequence of animal evolution. While panellists agreed that it is likely too extreme to say (in mammals at least) that learning relies on pre-wired recurrent circuits (as in echo state networks or liquid state machines [26]), there are clearly constraints imposed by the genetic code that may offer useful inductive biases for self-organization and learning.
