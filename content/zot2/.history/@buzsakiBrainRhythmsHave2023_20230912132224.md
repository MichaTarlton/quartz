> [!Excerpt] Abstract
> Neuronal oscillations offer access to neuronal operations, bringing microscopic and macroscopic mechanisms, experimental methods, and explanations to a common platform. The field of brain rhythms has become the agora of discussions from temporal coordination of neuronal populations within and across brain regions to cognitive phenomena, including language and brain diseases.

# Extracted Annotations and Comments
Studies of neuronal oscillations are as old as neuroscience itself. Yet, in-depth inquiry of neuronal oscillations had its earnest start only three decades ago. This pivotal change was mainly due to works that focused on the neuronal spike content of the various rhythms, their biophysical and circuit mechanisms, and drug responsiveness, which provided a link to circuit functions and, in turn, to cognitive phenomena. This mesoscopic link created a new platform, the field of ‘‘neuronal oscillations,’’ w (p. 922) 


> Simultaneity of two (or more) events may be deemed synchronous (i.e., occurring within a defined time interval of an observer) even if the two events occur at vastly different times. For example, action potentials arriving at the sametimeontothedendriteofa reader neuron from a nearby and distant neuron exert a cooperative impact on discharge of the reader (target) neuron, even though the spikes in the two upstream neurons were generated tens of milliseconds apart (Figure 1A). Conversely, action potentials that are generated at the same (clock) time in a nearby and distant neuron will arrive to the reader neuron tens of milliseconds apart (i.e., asynchronously; Figure 1B). 
> 
> This observer- or reader-defined synchrony is critical in brain operations. If the action potentials from many upstream neurons arrive within the membrane time constant of the target (reader) neuron (t: 10–50 ms for a typical pyramidal neuron), their combined action is cooperative because each of them contributes to the discharge of the reader neuron. Action potentials arriving later can only contribute to initiating another action potential. Thus, from the reader neuron’s point of view, upstream partners that contribute to its spike discharge constitute a functional assembly (integrated by the membrane time constant), whereas spikes outside this time window can only be part of another assembly.2 This simple functional measure can thus both integrate and segregate upstream neurons into discrete assemblies, irrespective of whether they are interconnected or not. ^4tk83b

> Communications via rhythms is effective because neuronal oscillators have a separate ‘‘duty’’ or sending phase when spiking information is transferred and a perturbation or ‘‘receiving’’ phase.6 These types of oscillators can synchronize robustly and rapidly in a single cycle, making them ideal for segmentation of spiking information in both time and space. Thus, neuronal oscillations have a dual function in brain networks: they are influenced by spiking inputs and, in turn, affect timing of spike outputs. In addition, rhythm cycles across regions can provide the information about message frames.

> Brain rhythms cover more than four orders of magnitude in frequency, from the infraslow (<0.01 Hz) to ultrafast (200 Hz) rhythms, and include at least ten interactive oscillation classes. Integrated over a long temporal scale, the power distribution of the various frequencies has the appearance of 1/frequency^n ‘‘noise,’’ partly reflecting the fact that slow oscillations generate large, synchronous membrane-potential fluctuations in many neurons in brain-wide networks, whereas faster oscillations are associated with smaller changes in membrane potential in a limited number of cells that are synchronized only within a restricted neural volume. ^umr7pm


> At the neuronal level, such multi-level nesting of phaseamplitude coupling reflects local-global computation, which is how distributed local processes are integrated into globally ordered states.


> The results of local computations are broadcast to widespread brain areas, and in the reverse direction, local computations and the direction of the activity flow of signals are coordinated by the phase of a global mechanism. We suggest that this global-local integration computation is the neurophysiological basis of various psychological constructs, known as ‘‘executive,’’ ‘‘attentional,’’ ‘‘contextual,’’ or ‘‘top-down’’ control. Prominent examples include the hippocampal theta phase coupling of neocortical gamma events so that the results of multiple neocortical computations can be delivered to the non-refractory phase of the theta cycle to integrate multiple modalities and the contextual control of primary visual cortex by higher-order areas via slower (alpha) oscillations.

Hippocampal theta oscillations illustrate this difference. Firing of neighboring assemblies (within successive gamma waves) in the theta cycle are correlated with the travel distance representation of the assembly pairs while the rat is walking on a track so that the assembly representing the current location of the rat fires at the trough of the theta cycle, whereas cell assemblies of the previously and subsequently visited places discharge on the descending and ascending phases (Figures 1G and 1H), spanning almost the entire theta cycle (thus forming a ‘‘neuronal letter’’).[[50 Reading/zot2/@buzsakiBrainRhythmsHave2023]]
