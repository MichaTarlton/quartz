> [!Excerpt] Abstract
> Abstract The Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model of interval timing uses many neural oscillators, presumably located in the frontal cortex (FC), to produce beats at a specific criterion time Tc. The coincidence detection produces the beats in the basal ganglia spiny neurons by comparing the current state of the FC neural oscillators against the long-term memory values stored at reinforcement time Tc. The neurobiologically realistic SBF model has been previously used for producing precise and scalar timing in the presence of noise. Here we simplified the SBF model to gain insight into the resource allocation problem in interval timing networks. Specifically, we used a noise-free SBF model to explore the lower limits of the number of neural oscillators required for producing accurate timing. Using abstract sine-wave neural oscillators in the SBF-sin model, we found that the lower limit of the number of oscillators needed is proportional to the criterion time Tc and the frequency span (fmax − fmin) of the FC neural oscillators. Using biophysically realistic Morris–Lecar model neurons in the SBF-ML model, the lower bound increased by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the SBF-sin model.

# Top Comments

Let's say grey is for overall comments
Ok so it wasn’t exactly what I expected, and I’m not certain what they are doing totally tracks to what I was trying.

They seem to use uniform oscillators but their testing of it does not appear to account for the weight dependencies
