# Abstract
This document aims to be a self-contained, mathematically precise overview of transformer architectures and algorithms (*not* results). It covers what transformers are, how they are trained, what they are used for, their key architectural components, and a preview of the most prominent models. The reader is assumed to be familiar with basic ML terminology and simpler neural network architectures such as MLPs.

# Quick Reference


# Top Comments

- Started, but not really very far into it. Would make for a good podcast thing with V.
- Just finished a quick read through and it’s dense than I thought, I quickly got lost in the “math”.
- He also links to an illustrated guide here [The Illustrated Transformer – Jay Alammar – Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)
	- The rest of the website  is pretty interesting and subbing to the YT channel[Jay Alammar – Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.](https://jalammar.github.io)
