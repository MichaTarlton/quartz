# Abstract
The processing of temporal intervals is essential to create causal maps and to predict future events so as to best adapt one’s behavior. In this review, we explore the different brain activity patterns associated with processing durations and expressing temporally-adapted behavior in animals. We begin by describing succinctly some of the current models of the internal clock that can orient us in what to look for in brain activity. We then outline how durations can be decoded by single cell activity and which activity patterns could be associated with interval timing. We further point to similar patterns that have been observed at a more global level within brain areas (e.g. local field potentials) or, even, between these areas, that could represent another way of encoding duration or could constitute a necessary part for more complex temporal processing. Finally, we discuss to what extent neural data fit with internal clock models, and highlight improvements for experiments to obtain a more indepth understanding of the brain’s temporal encoding and processing.

# Quick Reference

## CS : Conditioned Stimulus
## US : Unconditioned Stimulus


# Comments
Maybe I am looking to replicate one of these “cells” in a toy SNN circuit. But I want this circuit to train itself to do these.

Ok so if we can phase lock circuits then perhaps the global timing can be based on oscillations

# Topics

## Population encoding
This is the literature way to refer to what I like to call circuit encoding (or engrams)

Though I think there might be still a small difference, I can’t tell if they are using it synonymously or if pop encoding means more like “by popular support”

Slow (&lt; 50 Hz) oscillations are associated with large fluctuations of neurons’ membrane potential and are considered to cover large brain areas, whereas fast oscillations result from smaller fluctuations in membrane potential and should be restricted to smaller neural volumes.

We have organized these studies according to the type of task used, as well as the brain area where timing related activity was reported. The studied species, as well as the range of durations used, are also mentioned. We have categorized the modification of neurons’ firing patterns, as compared to baseline activity, in four types (see Fig. 1 for a schematic representation of the different activity patterns): (1) sustained change, (2) phasic change in activity at the stimulus onset or offset, whose amplitude and/or duration is proportional to the duration of the event, (3) peak modulation at a specific time point (‘event time’ cells), and (4) ramping activity. The changes reported are in majority in the direction of an increased cell firing, but several studies have also reported a decrease in cell firing, in particular when baseline levels of activity are high (e.g. Fuster and Alexander, 1973; Oshio et al., 2006).”* [(p. 150)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBVFC5PX?page=5&annotation=ESUZWILV)-

The increased activity during the delay could represent an encoding of the hazard rate, that is, the longer the duration, the more likely the stimulus is to appear (Heinen and Liu, 1997; Janssen and Shadlen, 2005; Leon and Shadlen, 2003; Lucchetti and Bon, 2001; Renoult et al., 2006; Riehle et al., 1997).

**Yeah. Duh**

> *“Sequential time cells Sequential time cells (also known as ‘time cells’) fire one after the other, creating, as a population, a range of firing across time which forms a bridge of activity between events separated by a constant time interval, thus encoding as a whole the event’s duration or the interval between events (Fig. 2A).”* [(p. 154)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBVFC5PX?page=9&annotation=KTEFE8E3)

**Response field? what is this?**

> *“et al., 2009; Mello et al., 2015). MacDonald et al. (2011) have differentiated cells depending on whether or not they modify their peak firing time when the duration of the interval is changed. They named ‘absolute time cells’ cells that show a peak response at a specific time point during the interval with a pattern that does not rescale when the duration is modified. ‘Relative time cells’ show a similar peak response at a specific time but their activity is rescaled depending on the duration of the timed interval. Other cells may either lose their activity or change their activity to a non-similar and non-rescaled time point when the interval is modified. Other studies have also highlighted the dichotomy between relative versus absolute time cells (Kojima and Goldman-Rakic, 1982; Merchant et al., 2011). To describe these sequential time cells, MacDonald and collaborators (2011) used a go/no-go paradigm with a delay. The rats were trained to pair objects and odors, such that they had to retain in memory for 10 s the object that was presented at the beginning of a trial to know whether or not they should dig into a scented pot to get a reward. During the 10 s delay, neurons in the hippocampus fired sequentially to cover the whole duration with a firing pattern that was rearranged when the duration was changed. Most neurons were modulated by both space and time, and in a manner independent of locomotion, speed, or head placement. In another study, it was shown that very few neurons depend only on time (MacDonald et al., 2013, 2011). Therefore, these sequential time cells seem similar, or even identical, to the place cells described in the hippocampus (O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971) and may interact with those cells to form spatiotemporal maps of the environment.

> *“These sequential time cells seem to constitute a “pure” time encoding which can support the encoding of long durations and, even, parallel encoding of multiple durations simultaneously. However, the questions remain of what makes these cells fire at a specific time (e.g., does it result from a local process or do they receive a temporal input from an upstream brain area), and of how to separate the different subpopulations representing different durations in different contexts.”* [(p. 155)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBVFC5PX?page=10&annotation=FD7JF67M)-  

**multiple time scale encoding,Also, ask Gustavo about this**

> *“Local field potentials (LFPs) LFPs represent the sum of depolarization/hyperpolarization of a population of neurons, reflecting action potentials as well as subthreshold electrical modulation such as EPSPs (excitatory post-synaptic potentials) and IPSPs (inhibitory post-synaptic potentials) (Buzsáki et al., 2012). It is important to note that LFPs represent both input activity (i.e. coming from upstream brain areas) as well as local computations and output, in contrast to single unit or multi-unit recordings which only reflect spikes, and thus output data of the recorded area.”* [(p. 155)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBVFC5PX?page=10&annotation=47XWGXBP)

> *“Some LFP modulations are time-locked to the onset of a stimulus and are called event related potentials or ERP (Fig. 2B). They can be observed when averaging a large number of trials under constant conditions”* [(p. 155)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBVFC5PX?page=10&annotation=FBV98TB2)

> *“The raw LFP signal (Fig. 2C) recorded from a brain area can also be decomposed in different frequency components (i.e., oscillations) that are considered to have different roles in neural processing. Data on oscillations are often presented in the form of power spectrum density (PSD), which represents the strength of different frequency bands in a signal. When looked at in a time-frequency manner, one can ask how the power of different frequency bands varies across a trial. Most frequency bands from slow oscillations (like delta and theta) to mid-range (like alpha and beta) and even high frequency oscillations (like gamma and epsilon) - have been described in several mammalian species, and neural oscillations seem to be a conserved phenomenon across mammalian evolution (Buzsáki et al., 2013).”* [(p. 155)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBVFC5PX?page=10&annotation=IIR7RRX4)

> *“Neuronal oscillations have long been hypothesized as the major constituent of the internal clock (Buhusi and Meck, 2005; Treisman, 1963).

**Implicit v. Explicit tasks**

> *“While changes in oscillatory power points to the involvement of a given brain area in timing - although the function of specific frequencies remains to be resolved - it does not give access to the recruitment of potential networks encompassing several structures. Synchronicity of oscillations between different structures, also called coherence (Fig. 2D), gives information about the communication between structures. When two structures are highly coherent, it is thought to make information transfer easier because the other structure is already primed to receive the spiking activity from the first (cf. the communication through coherence hypothesis, Fries, 2005).”* [(p. 156)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBVFC5PX?page=11&annotation=3YF9P3AV)

In that study, the phase-locking was increased significantly more in correct than incorrect trials within the 2 s period before the presentation of the stimulus indicating which hole to choose to get a reward (2 s before). A similar pattern was observed in the PL, but with phase-locking of spikes to beta oscillations (centered at 17 Hz). However, Nakazono et al. (2015), looking at single units and theta oscillations in the hippocampus in a temporal discrimination task, showed that only few cells were time-locked to the oscillations compared to the study by MacDonald et al. (2013). The authors suggested that the two types of activity may have different roles, albeit both related to time: theta oscillations might help the hippocampus to interact with the PFC at the correct time, whereas the spikes may encode both temporal and spatial/sensory information.”* [(p. 157)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBVFC5PX?page=12&annotation=PRJFE875)

> However, no study has yet shown increased coherence between striatum and prefrontal cortex during interval timing. Potentially adding on to the SBF model, data from our lab seems also to implicate the amygdala as a modulator of cortico-striatal synapses to maintain the memory of a previous duration when learning a new duration. So both memories are maintained even though behavioral expression shifts quickly to the new duration (see Dallérac et al., 2017, Figure 10).

> *“The TopDDM (Time Adaptative Opponent Poisson drift-diffusion model) is also a PA model, but based on the drift-diffusion model of decision-making (Balci and Simen, 2016; Simen et al., 2011). It considers, in very general terms, that the accumulation of time should be represented by a ramping activity which rate is inversely proportional to the duration encoded. As reported above, this type of activity has been described in multiple papers (e.g., Komura et al., 2001; Lebedev et al., 2008; Murakami et al., 2014).”* [(p. 158)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBVFC5PX?page=13&annotation=LSLHKXJN)

> *“There are also non-clock-based models; they require a population of units (can be neurons or group of neurons) that respond differently across time, which is consistent with the existence of sequential time cells. Included in those models is the TILT (Timing from Inverse Laplace transform) model from Shankar and Howard (2012), as well as the multi-timescale model (MTS) from Staddon and Higa (1999), and the Spectral Timing Model (Grossberg and Merrill, 1992). 
> 
> TILT model can also explain the scalar property of time as well as the recency effect of episodic memory (Howard et al., 2015). Its principle is that the presentation of a stimulus will activate a certain number of t nodes which will maintain a stable firing rate across the period of to-be-encoded time, and after the end of the interval decay exponentially to result in the activation of T nodes through an inverse Laplace transform. This will produce units that are active at a specific time point after the beginning of the stimulus. The different T nodes are activated sequentially and do not influence one another, they are instead influenced by the activity in the t nodes. Activities resembling to t nodes (stable increased firing) and to T nodes (sequential time cells) that when active during the early part of the interval have smaller spread of activity than cells activated later have both been reported in the literature. However, it remains to be determined to what extent they are found in all brain areas.”* [(p. 158)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBVFC5PX?page=13&annotation=IVBWGXYW)
