# Abstract
Humans and other animals can be shown to process temporal information as if they use an internal stopwatch that can be “run”, “paused”, and “reset” on command and whose speed of “ticking” is adjustable. In addition, interval-timing behavior can be separated into “clock”, “memory”, and “decision” stages of information processing such that one stage can be modified without changing the others. Moreover, interval-timing procedures can be used to diagnose the behavioral abnormalities associated with transgenic, “knock-out”, and “knock-down” mouse models of human diseases. In conjunction with interval-timing tasks, evaluation of spatial memory and emotional regulation provides the necessary information for identifying the most-likely locus of behavioral deficits in genetically modified mice. Consequently, the timing and immersive memory and emotional regulation (TIMER) test battery outlined here is recommended as a tool for behavioral phenotyping.

# Quick Reference
- coefficient of variation (CV)

# Top Comments
- Talking about [[Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model|(SBF)]] again
- Pulse accumulator models
- In SBF / PAM what decides the frequency of a pulse?
- [[Temporal Bisection Task|Temporal Bisection]] is covered
- They are proposing a standardized test battery of timing and memory 
	- This is specifically for genetically modified mice
## Summary
Skipped the genetics part

This seems to propose only a few interval timing tasks and mostly just variations on what I already know of, bisection and PI 

Not sure what to do with this honestly. 
- [ ] Perhaps revisit the variants and add them to your list of timing tasks #reading #p1
