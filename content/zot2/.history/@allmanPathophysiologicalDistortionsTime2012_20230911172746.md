> [!Excerpt] Abstract
> Distortions in time perception and timed performance are presented by a number of different neurological and psychiatric conditions (e.g. Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism). As a consequence, the primary focus of this review is on factors that define or produce systematic changes in the attention, clock, memory and decision stages of temporal processing as originally defined by Scalar Expectancy Theory. These findings are used to evaluate the Striatal Beat Frequency Theory, which is a neurobiological model of interval timing based upon the coincidence detection of oscillatory processes in corticostriatal circuits that can be mapped onto the stages of information processing proposed by Scalar Timing Theory.


# Quick Reference
==In this sense, the timekeeper of the striatal beat frequency model is not a ‘dedicated’ clock in that it makes use of neural processes that are coding other aspects of the stimulus, including basic working memory processes ([Lustig _et al_., 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491636/#awr210-B136)).==
