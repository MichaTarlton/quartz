# Abstract
Synaptic plasticity, induced by the close temporal association of two neural signals, supports associative forms of learning. However, the millisecond timescales for association often do not match the much longer delays for behaviorally relevant signals that supervise learning. In particular, information about the behavioral outcome of neural activity can be delayed, leading to a problem of temporal credit assignment. Recent studies suggest that synaptic plasticity can have temporal rules that not only accommodate the delays relevant to the circuit, but also be precisely tuned to the behavior the circuit supports. These discoveries highlight the diversity of plasticity rules, whose temporal requirements may depend on circuit delays and the contingencies of behavior.
