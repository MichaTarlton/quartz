> [!Excerpt] Abstract
> A conspicuous ability of the brain is to seamlessly assimilate and process spatial and temporal features of sensory stimuli. This ability is indispensable for the recognition of natural stimuli. Yet, a general computational framework for processing spatiotemporal stimuli remains elusive. Recent theoretical and experimental work suggests that spatiotemporal processing emerges from the interaction between incoming stimuli and the internal dynamic state of neural networks, including not only their ongoing spiking activity but also their ‘hidden’ neuronal states, such as short-term synaptic plasticity.
