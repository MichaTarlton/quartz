# Abstract
Humans and lower animals time as if using a stopwatch that can be “stopped” or “reset” on command. This view is challenged by data from the peak-interval procedure with gaps: Unexpected retention intervals (gaps) delay the response function in a seemingly continuous fashion, from stop to reset. We evaluated whether these results are an artifact of averaging over trials, or whether subjects use discrete alternatives or a continuum of alternatives in individual-trials: A Probability-of-Reset hypothesis proposes that in individual gap trials subjects stochastically use discrete alternatives (stop/reset), such that when averaged over trials, the response distribution in gap trials falls in between “stop” and “reset”. Alternatively, a Resource Allocation hypothesis proposes that during individual gap trials working memory for the pregap duration decays, such that the response function in individual gap trials is shifted rightward in a continuous fashion. Both hypotheses provided very good fits with the observed individual-trial distributions, although the Resource Allocation hypothesis generated reliably better fits. Results provide support for the usefulness of individual-trial analyses in dissociating theoretical alternatives in interval timing tasks.

Ok so based on the proposal of gap PI they want to test to see if there is a “continuum of responses in between stop and reset”
for the agents in gap trials

> In PI trials, the to-be-timed signal is presented but subject’s responses are not reinforced; typically, in PI trials the average response rate increases after the onset of the to-be-timed signal, reaches a peak about the time when subjects’ responses were (sometimes) reinforced, and declines afterwards ([Catania, 1970](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R19); [Church, 1978](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R21)) ([Figure 1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/figure/F1/)).

> During gap trials, a brief interruption (gap) of the to-be-timed signal prompts a delay in response relative to PI trials by about the duration of the gap, suggesting that on average subjects retain in working memory the pre-gap interval and resume timing after the gap where they left off before the gap, a response mode (alternative) called stop (e.g., [Church, 1978](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R21); [S. Roberts & Church, 1978](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R48)) ([Figure 1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/figure/F1/)).

> However, a quite different response pattern is observed in the reversed version of the PI procedure ([Buhusi & Meck, 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R7)), in which subjects time the absence of a signal (e.g., in the dark) and their timing is interrupted by a signaled (e.g., illuminated) gap ([Figure 1B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/figure/F1/)): Subjects delay their response function after the gap for a duration that is approximately the sum of the gap and pre-gap intervals, suggesting that on average they restart the entire timing process after the gap, using a reset response ([Buhusi & Meck, 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R7)).

> Subjects time the presence of a signal (Standard, panel A) or the absence of a signal (Reversed, panel B). Subjects are randomly presented with fixed-interval (FI) trials, peak-interval (PI) trials, and gap trials in which the to-be-timed signal is interrupted by a retention-interval (gap). The upper graphs show that in PI trials the average response rate peaks at the to-be-timed interval, and that the presentation of a gap delays the response function. \* = reinforcement.


> Here we evaluate whether the pattern of response in individual gap trials is consistent with either discrete modes of the internal clock ([Gibbon et al., 1984](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R32)) or a continuum of alternatives ([Buhusi, 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R4)). To reconcile these views, [Cabeza de Vaca et al. (1994)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R18) proposed a “stochastic” model, denoted here as the Probability-of-Reset hypothesis (PR), which assumes that during individual gap trials subjects use discrete alternatives (stop / reset) with a certain probability, such that the average response functions in gap trials is a mix of the “stop and “reset” responses, thus falling in between stop and reset, and giving the appearance of a continuous range of alternatives. This distinction is lost when analyzing average response functions, and requires special individual-trial analyses.
