# Abstract
The spiking neural network architecture (SpiNNaker) project aims to deliver a massively parallel million-core computer whose interconnect architecture is inspired by the connectivity characteristics of the mammalian brain, and which is suited to the modeling of large-scale spiking neural networks in biological real time. Specifically, the interconnect allows the transmission of a very large number of very small data packets, each conveying explicitly the source, and implicitly the time, of a single neural action potential or “spike.” In this paper, we review the current state of the project, which has already delivered systems with up to 2500 processors, and present the real-time event-driven programming model that supports flexible access to the resources of the machine and has enabled its use by a wide range of collaborators around the world.
