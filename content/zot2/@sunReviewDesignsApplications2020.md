# Abstract
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have demonstrated their outstanding ability in sequence tasks and have achieved state-of-the-art in wide range of applications, such as industrial, medical, economic and linguistic. Echo State Network (ESN) is simple type of RNNs and has emerged in the last decade as an alternative to gradient descent training based RNNs. ESN, with a strong theoretical ground, is practical, conceptually simple, easy to implement. It avoids non-converging and computationally expensive in the gradient descent methods. Since ESN was put forward in 2002, abundant existing works have promoted the progress of ESN, and the recently introduced Deep ESN model opened the way to uniting the merits of deep learning and ESNs. Besides, the combinations of ESNs with other machine learning models have also overperformed baselines in some applications. However, the apparent simplicity of ESNs can sometimes be deceptive and successfully applying ESNs needs some experience. Thus, in this paper, we categorize the ESN-based methods to basic ESNs, DeepESNs and combinations, then analyze them from the perspective of theoretical studies, network designs and specific applications. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of ESNs by summarizing the open questions and proposing possible future works.

But when the length of input sequence exceeds a certain limit, the gradient will still disappear. Meanwhile, each LSTM cell have four full connection layers, if the time span of LSTM is large and the network is very deep, the calculation will be very heavy and time-consuming. Further, too many parameters will lead to over fitting risk.”* (p. 1)

> *“Echo State Network (ESN) [6] is one of the key RC. ESNs are practical, conceptually simple, and easy to implement. ESNs employ the multiple high-dimensional projection in the large number of states of the reservoir with strong nonlinear mapping capabilities, to capture the dynamics of the input. This basic idea was first clearly spelled out in a neuroscientific model of the corticostriatal processing loop [3]. ESNs enjoy, under mild conditions, the so-called echo state property [6], that ensures that the effect of the initial condition vanishes after a finite transient. The inputs with more similar short-term history will evoke closer echo states, which ensure the dynamical stability of the reservoir.”* (p. 2)-

> *“ensure the dynamical stability of the reservoir. Recently, the introduction of the Deep Echo State Network (DeepESN) model [11, 12] allowed to study the properties of layered RNN architectures separately from the learning aspects. Remarkably, such studies pointed out that the structured state space organization with multiple time-scales dynamics in deep RNNs is intrinsic to the nature of compositionality of recurrent neural modules. The interest in the study of the DeepESN model is hence twofold. On the one hand, it allows to shed light on the intrinsic properties of state dynamics of layered RNN architectures. On the other hand it enables the design of extremely efficiently trained deep neural networks for temporal data.”* (p. 2)

> *“Meanwhile, with the development of deep learning, a variety of neural network structures have been proposed, like auto-encoder (AE) [13], generative adversarial networks (GAN) [14], convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [15] and restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) [16]. ESNs have combined these different structures and achieved state-of-the-art performance in specific tasks and different applications, such as industrial [17], medical [18], financial [19] and robotics with reinforcement learning [20, 21].”* (p. 2)-
