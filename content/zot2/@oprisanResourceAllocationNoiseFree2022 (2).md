> [!Excerpt] Abstract
> Abstract The Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model of interval timing uses many neural oscillators, presumably located in the frontal cortex (FC), to produce beats at a specific criterion time Tc. The coincidence detection produces the beats in the basal ganglia spiny neurons by comparing the current state of the FC neural oscillators against the long-term memory values stored at reinforcement time Tc. The neurobiologically realistic SBF model has been previously used for producing precise and scalar timing in the presence of noise. Here we simplified the SBF model to gain insight into the resource allocation problem in interval timing networks. Specifically, we used a noise-free SBF model to explore the lower limits of the number of neural oscillators required for producing accurate timing. Using abstract sine-wave neural oscillators in the SBF-sin model, we found that the lower limit of the number of oscillators needed is proportional to the criterion time Tc and the frequency span (fmax − fmin) of the FC neural oscillators. Using biophysically realistic Morris–Lecar model neurons in the SBF-ML model, the lower bound increased by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the SBF-sin model.

The results presented here concern the resource allocation during interval timing. In particular, we studied the relationship between the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) and the number of neural oscillators allocated to a timing task in the absence of any noise.

However, sine (or phase) oscillators have been used in mathematical ecology and the temporal evolution of biological systems (Guckenheimer & Holmes, 1983; Izhikevich, 2000; Winfree, 2001). They proved invaluable in uncovering universal laws of large-scale neural dynamics (Kuramoto, 1984; Kuznetsov, 2004). In principle, any neural oscillator can be reduced to a phase oscillator near a bifurcation point (Ermentrout, 1986).

One such implementation uses Morris and Lecar (1981) spiking neurons instead of sine waved to model neural activity (Oprisan & Buhusi, 2013).

> 	As expected, in the SBF-ML model, the noise level decreases with the neural oscillators’ number (see Fig. 4a). The normalized activation function (determined by the FC to BG weights) shows a more substantial peak at the expected criterion time Tc = 20 s with the increasing number of neural oscillators and a simultaneous reduction in background noise level.

> 	Similar to the SBF-sin model prediction, we notice that in the SBF-ML model, a more significant number of neural oscillators leads initially to an increase in the SNR followed by its saturation (see Fig. 4c). One notable difference is that the saturation starts at a considerably larger number of neural oscillators, i.e., the SBF-ML model needs a significantly larger number of neural oscillators than the SBF-sin model to resolve the peak of the output function and produce precise timing.

> 	Since the SBF model relies on the set of states of neural oscillators to resolve the output function’s peak, a sine wave offers many discrete values that could encode the state of the FC. For example, an f= 8 Hz sine wave oscillator could be covered by n=1/(fts) = 125 ML neurons, each firing with a spike duration ts = 1 ms.

> 	We also notice from Fig. 4d that the SNR decreases as the criterion time Tc increases for a fixed number of neural oscillators. The reason is that the quantization (discretization or sampling) error of every cosine wave of the time base with a given number of ML spikes of ts = 1 ms duration increases with the to-be-timed duration.

An ML action potential, especially for Type I oscillators used here (Ermentrout, 1986; Rinzel and Ermentrout, 1998), looks like a very sharp spike, which could be assimilated to a delta function for long firing periods. As a result, a sine wave sampled every 1–3 ms over its period will require a considerable number of sampling points, which translates into a large number of ML neural oscillators needed for covering the same discrete values of the membrane potential as a sine wave.

However, if spiking neurons are used, like in our SBF-ML model, the numbers above increase by orders of magnitude. This is because every sine wave of frequency fmust be sampled with short spikes (action potentials) of duration ts, which lead to a factor of n=1/(fts).

In the SBF-ML model (Fig. 4d), the SNR does not exceed 10 units, which corresponds to 20 log10 SNR = 20 dB. At the same time, from Fig. 3d, we notice that the SNR for the SBF-sin model exceeds 100 units, i.e., more than 40 dB. The SNR for most electrophysiological recordings is right at the edge of 20 dB (Suarez-Perez et al., 2018; Venkatachalam et al., 2011)

> Figure 2. The elements of the theoretical output function of the noise-free SBF-sin (sine-wave) model. Theoretical output function of a noise-free SBF-sin model (equation(2)) for a criterion time Tc = 10 s using a variable number of FC oscillators: 10 (a1), 20 (b1), and 40 (c1). The denominator of the theoretical output function (a2–b2–c2) represents the envelope of the output function shown in panels a1–c1. The numerator of the theoretical output function (a3–b3–c3) represents the fast oscillating part of the output function shown in panels a1–b1c1 that fills in the envelopes shown in panels a2–b2–c2.

> Figure 3. The signal-to-noise ratio of a noise-free SBF-sin (sine-wave) model. The theoretical output function (equation (2)), marked with the thin continuous line, was beta spline interpolated (see the thick dashed line) to get the maximum and minimum amplitude of the output signal. The minimum of the envelope decreases, leading to an increase in the SNR, as the number of neural oscillators increases from 20 (a) to the minimum required 40 (b) for a Tc = 10 s (see equation (5)). For more than the minimum number of required oscillators, e.g., 60 oscillators in panel (c), the minimum amplitude of the envelope was measured by averaging over a 3σinterval starting from t= 0 s. As seen in panel (d), the SNR linearly increases with the number of oscillators until the minimum number is reached, and then the SNR saturates. The SNR behavior is consistent over a wide range of criteria from 10 s to 100 s.

> Figure 4. The signal-to-noise ratio of a noise-free SBF-ML (Morris–Lecar) model. The output function of the SBF-ML model shows a more substantial peak at the criterion time Tc = 20 s as we increase the number of neural oscillators (a). For the same criterion time, the background noise amplitude decreases by increasing the number of neural oscillators (a). The output functions of the SBF-ML model (thin continuous lines) were fitted with a smooth beta spline curve (thick long dashed line for Tc= 20 s, thick dotted line for Tc= 40 s, and thick dashed-dotted line for Tc= 80 s) that allowed us to estimate the background noise level (b). To determine the location of the peak of the output function and the standard deviation σ, we used a Gaussian curve (see continuous line) to fit the output of the SBF-ML model (see dotted lines) (c). The noise level was measured by averaging the output function starting 3σfrom the criterion time (b). The SNR increases with the number of neural oscillators and eventually saturates (d). For a fixed number of neural oscillators, as the criterion time increases from Tc = 20 s (solid red rectangles) to Tc = 40 s (solid green circles) to Tc = 80 s (solid blue triangles), the SNR decreases.
