> [!Excerpt] Abstract
> Durations are defined by a beginning and an end, and a major distinction is drawn between durations that start in the present and end in the future (‘prospective timing’) and durations that start in the past and end either in the past or the present (‘retrospective timing’). Different psychological processes are thought to be engaged in each of these cases. The former is thought to engage a clock-like mechanism that accurately tracks the continuing passage of time, whereas the latter is thought to engage a reconstructive process that utilizes both temporal and non-temporal information from the memory of past events. We propose that, from a biological perspective, these two forms of duration estimation are supported by computational processes that are both reliant on population state dynamics but are nevertheless distinct. Prospective timing is effectively carried out in a single step where the ongoing dynamics of population activity directly serve as the computation of duration, whereas retrospective timing is carried out in two steps: the initial generation of population state dynamics through the process of event segmentation and the subsequent computation of duration utilizing the memory of those dynamics.

This study demonstrates that motor timing can be carried out by controlling the speed at which neural trajectories evolve, which is reflected in the temporal scaling of single-unit responses. Recurrent neural networks trained to perform the same timing task also reach the same solution for controlling the speed at which population activity evolves.  #rd #p5 🛫2023-09-11

> ^GBZ9257QaRQ4WIXTAp1

> ## Population clock The encoding of temporal information through changes in neural population activity over time. Explicit timing Prospective timing in which subjects are aware that they should attend to the passage of time to either estimate a duration defined by external events or generate a timed action. Neural trajectory A sequence of population states over time which describe the evolution of neural population activity. Implicit timing Prospective timing in which no overt timing behaviour is required. #tp

> 	Early models proposed that the internal clock would be implemented through a pacemakeraccumulator mechanism11–13 in which pulses generated by a central pacemaker would be integrated by an accumulator to generate estimates of time. However, outside the circadian system14,15, evidence for biological implementation of such a mechanism has been missing
> ^EVQMC36YaRQ4WIXTAp1

> [!Highlight] Page 646
> 	Subsequently, it has been proposed that the internal clock is implemented through coincidence detection of oscillatory activity patterns16–18, but, even though changes in oscillatory activity have been correlated to timing behaviour19–21, evidence of coincidence detection has also been missing.

> 	First, retrospective timing is operationally defined as the estimation of a duration when subjects are unaware beforehand that they will estimate the duration, whereas prospective timing is defined as estimation of duration when subjects are aware beforehand161. The logic of this operational definition is that, particularly during prospective timing, subjects have the opportunity to explicitly track the passage of time. Thus, in the case where estimation occurs after the duration has ended but subjects are already aware beforehand that they will eventually estimate duration, this would still be considered prospective timing.

> [!Highlight] Page 647
> 	Second, ‘prospective timing’ and ‘retrospective timing’ refer specifically to the estimation of duration, even though timing encompasses temporal order in addition to duration. Whether there exists a similar distinction between temporal order based on ongoing events as opposed to memory of past events is unclear.

> [!Highlight] Page 647
> 	Finally, ‘prospective timing’ overlaps with other commonly used terms such as ‘interval timing’ and ‘reward timing’, whereas ‘retrospective timing’ partially overlaps with ‘episodic timing’, and each has also been referred to as ‘experienced duration’ and ‘remembered duration’, respectively335.
