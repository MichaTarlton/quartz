> [!Excerpt] Abstract
> New computing technologies inspired by the brain promise fundamentally different ways to process information with extreme energy efficiency and the ability to handle the avalanche of unstructured and noisy data that we are generating at an ever-increasing rate. To realize this promise requires a brave and coordinated plan to bring together disparate research communities and to provide them with the funding, focus and support needed. We have done this in the past with digital technologies; we are in the process of doing it with quantum technologies; can we now do it for brain-inspired computing?

> Fig. 1 | Computational demands are increasing rapidly. a, The increase in computing power demands over the past four decades expressed in petaFLOPS days. Until 2012, computing power demand doubled every 24 months; recently this has shortened to approximately every 2 months. The colour legend indicates different application domains. Data are from ref. 3. b, Improvements in AI hardware efficiency over the past five years. State-of-the-art solutions have driven increases in computing efficiency of more than 300 times. Solutions in research and development promise further improvements22–24. c, Increase since 2011 of the costs of training AI models. Such an exponential increase is clearly unsustainable. Data are from ref. 25.
