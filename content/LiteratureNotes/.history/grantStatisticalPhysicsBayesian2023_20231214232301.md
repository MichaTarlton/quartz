> [!Excerpt] Abstract
> Lecture notes from the course given by Professor Sara A. Solla at the Les Houches summer school on "Statistical physics of Machine Learning". The notes discuss neural information processing through the lens of Statistical Physics. Contents include Bayesian inference and its connection to a Gibbs description of learning and generalization, Generalized Linear Models as a controlled alternative to backpropagation through time, and linear and non-linear techniques for dimensionality reduction.
