> [!Excerpt] Abstract
> Abstract The major tenets of beat-frequency/coincidence-detection models of reward-related timing are reviewed in light of recent behavioral and neurobiological findings. This includes the emphasis on a core timing network embedded in the motor system that is comprised of a corticothalamic-basal ganglia circuit. Therein, a central hub provides timing pulses (i.e., predictive signals) to the entire brain, including a set of distributed satellite regions in the cerebellum, cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus that are selectively engaged in timing in a manner that is more dependent upon the specific sensory, behavioral, and contextual requirements of the task. Oscillation/coincidence-detection models also emphasize the importance of a tuned ‘perception’ learning and memory system whereby target durations are detected by striatal networks of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) through the coincidental activation of different neural populations, typically utilizing patterns of oscillatory input from the cortex and thalamus or derivations thereof (e.g., population coding) as a time base. The measure of success of beat-frequency/coincidence-detection accounts, such as the Striatal Beat-Frequency model of reward-related timing (SBF), is their ability to accommodate new experimental findings while maintaining their original framework, thereby making testable experimental predictions concerning diagnosis and treatment of issues related to a variety of dopamine-dependent basal ganglia disorders, including Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease.

This core timing network provides timing pulses (i.e., predictive signals to meaningful stimuli) to the entire brain independent of the temporal-processing context. In addition to this central timing hub, there are a set of distributed satellite regions in the cerebellum, cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and elsewhere that are selectively engaged in timing depending on the specific sensory, behavioral, and contextual requirements of the task (e.g., Lusk et al., 2016; Meck & Ivry, 2016; Merchant & Yarrow, 2016; Petter et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2013).

These neurons can hold temporal ‘memories’ via DA-facilitated long-term potentiation and long-term depression possibly via AMPA receptor trafficking (Centonze et al., 2001).

This results in adjustments of corticostriatal synaptic weights by MSNs in the dorsal striatum, thus tuning the MSNs to specific patterns of coincident oscillatory activity and increasing their likelihood of firing upon similar patterns of cortical activation in the future (Kononowicz & van Rijn, 2014a, 2015).

Conversely, inhibition of protein synthesis in the ventral striatum, but not the dorsal striatum, impairs the acquisition of the ‘Stop’ decision threshold (MacDonald et al., 2012).

These oscillatory patterns can be represented at the level of the MSNs as direct spiking input, a sinusoidal type population signal, or a nearly infinite number of possibilities given the richness of the oscillatory time base (see Matell & Meck, 2004).

(2019) have recently proposed a neuromechanistic model for rhythmic beat generation based on the concept of a gamma counter considering the fact that gamma rhythms (30–90 Hz) are ubiquitous throughout the brain (e.g., Buzsáki & Wang, 2012). Therefore, they modeled 40-Hz gamma oscillations to form two discrete-time clocks that count the number of gamma cycles between specific events. The idea is similar to the pacemaker–accumulator models mentioned above in that they both make use of a counting mechanism. During the development of their beat generation model, Bose et al. (2019) acknowledged that pacemaker–accumulator and oscillator-based models of interval timing are related in a number of important ways. For example, in pacemaker–accumulator models, the accumulator and its reset are equivalent to the integrate-and-fire (IF) class of models, i.e., given regular input, the state variable rises linearly toward a target value for a non-leaky IF model and with a decreasing slope for a leaky IF model (LIF); the accumulator resets once the state variable exceeds the temporal criterion threshold.

> 	These IF/LIF models are essentially dynamic system oscillators, and are also nonlinear as a result of the employed reset mechanism. It was noted, however, that the time constant/integration rate required for beat-based situations is reliably slower than in typical applications of IF models for neuronal computations where timescales of 10–30 ms are more common. As a consequence, these models exhibit entrainment and phase-locking properties and show a phase difference among the stimuli.

This has the advantage of allowing the pacemaker–accumulator model to learn the correct phase and period, allowing the subject to continue to hold on the beat even after resetting (see Gu et al., 2011 for a possible example of this).

(2019) described the features of the SBF model that make it distinctive and set it apart from other models of interval timing. In essence, the SBF model uses neuronal oscillators with different fixed frequencies in an unusual way (see Miall, 1989).

Oscillatory Properties of the Time Base There are potentially significant advantages of having an oscillatory time base composed of regularly repeating patterns of oscillation that are widely observed in the cortex and striatum. One is that such regulatory activity is an important aspect of sensory processing and interval timing that allows synchronization of information-processing in different brain areas, including the types of resource allocation underlying dynamic attending and working memory (e.g., Breska & Deouell, 2017; Cravo et al., 2013; Gu et al., 2015; Haegens & Golumbic, 2018; Henry & Herrmann, 2014; Herbst & Landau, 2016; Kösem et al., 2014; Meck & Benson, 2002; Teki et al. (2017) − but see Breska & Deouell, 2016 for an example of when synchronizing to distracting rhythms is detrimental to shifting attention, and van Ede et al., 2018 for a cautionary note on whether neural oscillations contained within certain frequency ranges are best viewed as sustained rhythms or transient burst events). These synchronized oscillations allow the time base to change in a systematic fashion as a function of time, thus proving additional temporal information in the repeated subsets (phase harmonics) of the oscillating time base. Consequently, even though cortical firings occur in the millisecond range, the summation of these firings provides an oscillatory pattern (time base) from which subjects can discriminate target durations in the seconds-to-minutes-to-hours

These harmonics potentially provide a rich source of temporal information supporting concepts such as less than (shorter) or greater than (longer) − see Cordes & Meck (2014), Coull & Droit-Volet (2018), and Droit-Volet (2016).

> 	As noted above, the concepts of ‘shorter’ and ‘longer’ can be readily obtained from the SBF model by tracking the harmonics derived from primary coincidence detection of the entrained target duration (see Matell & Meck, 2004, fig. 3a). These harmonics in neural activity occur at fractions and multiples of the target duration and are specifically filtered by a ‘threshold’ in the SBF model with reference to the sharpening of responses to the target durations as temporal discriminations are acquired (see Matell & Meck, 2004, p. 165).

> 	Likewise, the behavioral training procedures typically used in animal timing studies would be designed to inhibit responses by subjects that are not associated with the response requirements for earning reinforcement, i.e., responding too early or too late. Nevertheless, subjects could theoretically be sensitive to these harmonics and reveal them in behavior not regimented by the reinforcement contingencies. Consequently, the harmonic information in the time base could be used by subjects to make a number of different temporal judgments, including halving or doubling of the interval.

> 	Under standard training conditions, this would only be possible if the rhythmical behavior were to occur in an ancillary response not directly related to the reinforcement contingencies. For example, if rats’ lever pressing were the reinforced response, food cup checking would be an ancillary response that the animals might make in anticipation of food delivery that would not directly be shaped by the reinforcement contingencies and hence might reveal uninhibited patterns of rhythmical behavior entrained to the target duration. Additionally, even if rhythmical patterns of responding for the reinforced response are inhibited by the reinforcement contingencies, they may be revealed by pharmacological treatments with dopaminergic drugs, such as quinpirole, known to remove inhibition from motor systems.

(2011) was designed to address the possibility that rhythmical behaviors (reflecting an underlying oscillatory time base) that are normally inhibited by the reinforcement contingencies can be disinhibited within the context of a model for obsessive/compulsive behavior (see Corbit et al., 2019). The primary findings reported by Gu et al. (2011) were that rhythmical patterns of responding were indeed observed in an ancillary response (food cup checking) as well as in the reinforced response (lever pressing) following the administration of quinpirole to rats trained on a 40-s peak interval (PI) procedure of the type used to establish the fundamental properties of interval timing (see Church et al., 1994; Yin et al., 2017). Taken together, these data provide strong support for an oscillatory time base underlying interval timing as currently implemented in the SBF model.

> 	3.3. Entrainment of the Oscillatory Time Base In line with the oscillatory time base, the SBF model of reward-related timing was extended to include the encoding of information in working memory. This version of the SBF timing model utilizes a type of resource allocation of working memory that proposes that memory resources can be flexibly distributed among several items such that the precision of working memory decreases with the number of items to be encoded (Gu et al., 2015). This type of hybrid model is consistent with human performance in working-memory tasks based on visual, auditory as well as temporal stimulus patterns. At the neural-network level, a coupled excitatory/inhibitory oscillation (EIO) feature was added to the SBF model to show how interval timing and working memory can originate from the same oscillatory processes but differ in terms of which dimension of the neural oscillation is utilized for item extraction, temporal order, and duration information.

This model uses a Gaussian distribution of oscillator frequencies (e.g. mean 6.5 Hz with 0.2-Hz SD, allowing variation between 6 and 7 Hz) and hypothesizes that these thetaexcitatory oscillators can produce delta oscillations (mean 0.5 Hz with 0.2-Hz SD) through an interaction with synchronized theta inhibitory inputs. As a consequence, the resulting coincident pattern of delta oscillators functions as the time base

In addition, multiple studies showed the increase of neural oscillations with interval timing (Emmons et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2015; Suzuki & Tanaka 2019). For example, low-frequency oscillations including theta and delta oscillations were increased during the encoding and comparison of duration information in the corticostriatal circuits (Gu et al., 2018).

> 	Unlike the original STT model, which postulates the accumulation of pacemaker pulses, multi-frequency EIO-based neurons oscillate over time, allowing a unique phase pattern to be observed at any given time (e.g., occurrence of a salient event). The phase pattern is essentially a timestamp, that can be represented by a relatively small number of EIO neurons and easily stored in memory (e.g., Gu et al., 2015).

Furthermore, in order to maintain the computational accessibility offered by the STT model, the phase pattern (i.e., timestamp) of the EIO model is not arbitrary, but rather a combinatorial coding for any given time. Using combinatorial coding as timestamps, the signal onset problem is also solved and the scalar property naturally emerges when the EIO oscillators are allowed to have Gaussian variation. As a consequence, duration estimation based on combinational coding provides a straightforward solution for solving the computational accessibility problems encountered by other models, as well as the unbounded accumulator and biological plausibility concerns outlined above (Shi et al., 2022).

However, by adding different amounts of variance to each oscillator independently, it allows a change in oscillator precision within a constrained limit considering that they are in a network receiving feedback. Taken together, this leads to a systematic relation between frequency bands and time representation − a type of chronotropy.

For example, a triggering event (e.g., light or sound) can drive various frequencies of excitatory oscillators in the beta frequency range across a cell population (desynchronized) with relatively synchronized inhibitory oscillators. The excitatory and inhibitory inputs produce beta rhythms entrained in delta or a slower frequency, and this pattern can be maintained during subsecond durations. As noted above, in the EIO–SBF model, the coincident firing pattern of a relevant neuronal group encodes the duration information for a time interval. For example, the 0.4-s time cells are a neuronal group showing a firing peak around 0.4 s and their population firing produces beta rhythms whose power peaks at 0.4 s. Other groups of time cells represent different durations in a similar fashion (Gu et al., 2015).

The primary concern here is that ramping functions are typically unable to account for the scalar property of interval timing or the continued ability to keep track of time for multiple durations after they resolve following the first target duration (Kononowicz & Penney, 2016; van Rijn et al., 2011).

In many instances, however, the use of the term ‘ramping’ likely functions as a descriptive label that means little more than something that is increasing monotonically as a function of time; whereas for how long it will last and how it will eventually resolve are not usually known unless appropriate probe trials are used, which is often not the case.

Firstly, a climbing neural activity-like pattern of behavior has been shown to be present across a broad range of intervals and brain regions. Secondly, the slope of the climbing neural activity is typically a function of the length of the interval, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying the climbing neural activity are sensitive to the intended target duration (Mita et al., 2009), a phenomenon usually referred to as temporal scaling or time scale invariance (Gibbon et al., 1997). Interestingly, beside this ‘classical’ climbing neural activity trace that superficially resembles an accumulating or ramping pattern, Merchant and colleagues were able to demonstrate that at the level of individual spiking neurons a much richer spectrum of neural activity patterns can be observed (Merchant et al., 2011, 2014).

These firing patterns in rats were similar to those identified by Merchant et al. (2011) in monkeys and included ramps, peaks, and dips − all with different slopes, directions, and times at which maxima or minima occurred during a single trial. Based on these findings, Matell et al. (2011) advocated for the formal modeling of these different sources and forms of neural activity under the assumption that the utilization of the full range of different temporal markers (e.g., positive and negative ramps, U-shaped functions, and peaks with independent slopes and minimal/ maximal firing rates at different times within a single trial) would lead to an improvement in temporal prediction and therefore increase temporal accuracy and precision.

Interestingly, the ensemble analysis provided relatively little improvement in temporal accuracy or precision over individual neurons that tracked the durations by producing Gaussian-shaped neural firing patterns centered around the target durations with the form of the response and the maximal response rates (peak rates) held nearly constant for the two target durations. The importance of individual neurons to the observed reward-related timing behavior contributed to the implementation of individual neuron ‘perceptron-like’ duration detectors in the SBF model of reward-related timing, and leading to similar conclusions while also documenting these results, theoretical work has proposed the idea that these neuronal patterns that are typically interpreted as evidence of accumulation can also serve as a threshold mechanism that could be distinguished from more gradual accumulator-like activations (Moutard et al., 2015; Simen, 2012).

Interestingly, Schneider and Ghose (2012) demonstrated that at the level of individual spiking neurons, time judgments are just as likely to be associated with a decrease of the spiking rate (see Kojima & Goldman-Rakic, 1982).

Because the D2R MSNs are more excitable than D1R MSNs, they tend to fire earlier, but with smaller amplitudes in response to synchronized cortical inputs, potentiating the indirect pathway. As time progresses, the D1R MSNs are activated by a matching pattern of cortical input with large amplitudes, potentiating the direct pathway (Kitano et al., 2002). The net effects of D1R MSNs and D2R MSNs at BG output is computed by either SNpr or GPi, and if the difference surpasses a threshold, the BG output is initiated, providing a ‘Go’ signal that can be regarded as the ‘Start’ time in timing tasks such as the PI procedure (e.g., MacDonald et al., 2012).

In addition, activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on FSIs can also lead to a transient postsynaptic inhibition of both types of MSNs.

Since the regulation of ‘Stop’ times in this way is determined by the responsivity of D2R as well as D1R MSNs to cortical inputs, manipulations on dopaminergic or cholinergic systems could, in theory, modulate the ‘Stop’ times in accordance with, or independent of the regulation of the ‘Start’ time, depending on the nature of the manipulations on the temporal dynamics of dopaminergic and cholinergic systems (see De Corte et al., 2019).

For example, K* < 1 represents an increase in memory storage speed for physostigmine and K* > 1 represents a decrease in memory storage speed for atropine. This effect gradually emerges as a function of repeated training sessions, at which point it stabilizes and is maintained by continued drug administrations, lesions, degeneracy and/or or aging (Lewis & Meck, 2012; Meck, 1996, 2002; Oprisan & Buhusi, 2011; Yin & Meck, 2014).

Summary and Future Directions The SBF model remains one of the most successful computational models of interval timing in terms of explaining the neural correlates of behavior across a broad range of timing procedures. The model continues to serve as an important guidepost for interpreting current data and directing future research involving neural oscillations and their entrainment (e.g., Grabot et al., 2019; Gupta & Chen, 2016; Hashimoto & Yotsumoto, 2015, 2018; Iversen & Balasubramaniam, 2016; Kononowicz & van Wassenhove, 2016; Kononowicz et al., 2018; Wiener & Kanai, 2016), dopaminergic mechanisms (e.g., Farrell, 2011; Oprisan & Buhusi, 2011; Soares et al., 2016), BG functions (e.g., Gu et al., 2018; Harrington & Jahanshahi, 2016; Jahanshahi et al., 2006; Jones & Jahanshahi, 2014; Teki et al., 2011; Toda et al., 2017; van Rijn et al., 2011), and strengthening of cortical–striatal synaptic connections as a function of the amount of training in duration discriminations (e.g., Dallérac et al., 2017; Doyère & El Massioui, 2016)

In accordance with the apparent dichotomy in D1R-direct and D2R-indirect dorsal striatal MSNs, the current review presents a proposal of how the SBF model can be modified in order to account for new behavioral and neurobiological findings.

It has been recently observed, for example, that sequences of neural activity in the striatum exhibit the ability to temporally rescale their dynamics, dilating or contracting the sequence duration by up to a factor of five in proportion to the intervals being timed in order to earn a reward (Mello et al., 2015).

One issue here is that population codes based on neurons that have a Poisson distribution of spike probabilities generate behavioral and computational properties that can be understood in terms of the tuning properties of individual cells in a manner very similar to that specified by the SBF model and consistent with the Poisson properties of STT (e.g., Averbeck et al., 2006; Gibbon, 1992; Sanger, 2003).

Given the regular occurrence of rewards at 7.5-, 10-, and 15-s intervals as used by Toda et al.

(B) When the clock and memory patterns match as determined by coincidence detection, the spiny neurons fire to indicate that the interval has elapsed (adapted from Allman and Meck, 2012; Matell and Meck, 2004).

The corticostriatal and the corticocerebellar pathways are connected to each other, the thalamus, and the pre-SMA/SMA (supplementary motor area) through multiple loops (adapted from Allman et al., 2014; Teki et al. 2012).

> Figure 4. The double summation (DS) extension of the striatal-beat-frequency (SBF) model of reward-related timing. (A) The baseline situation. Coincidental cortical inputs activate both D1R direct pathway MSNs and D2R indirect pathway MSNs. Because the D2R MSNs are more excitable, they can be activated by a less similar pattern of activation or simply by extracellular dopamine (DA). D1R MSNs depend more on a matching pattern of coincidental glutamatergic inputs. Therefore, D2R MSNs have smaller time constants than D1R MSNs. The net effects at basal ganglia (BG) outputs are the summation of the direct and the indirect pathway, and the decision threshold corresponds to the ‘Start’ time. (B) The D2R agonist suppresses D2R MSNs but also suppresses D1R MSNs via reduction of cholinergic tone (Wang et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2019), resulting in relatively unchanged ‘Start’ time. (C) The D2R antagonist disinhibits D2R MSNs, therefore produces a rightward shift of ‘Start’ time. The degree of shift should be correlated to the D2R affinity of the drug used. Chronic blockade of D2Rs would lead to homeostatic upregulation of D2Rs, normalizing the effect. (D) A DAT blocker (e.g., cocaine and methamphetamine) increases extracellular DA, and thus activates D2Rs that suppresses D2R MSNs without causing LTD at D1R MSNs, resulting in a leftward shift of ‘Start’ time. Chronic elevation of extracellular dopamine leads to downregulation of D2Rs, normalizing the effect.
