> [!Excerpt] Abstract
> To guide behavior and learn from its consequences, the brain must represent time over many scales. Yet, the neural signals used to encode time in the seconds-to-minute range are not known. The striatum is a major input area of the basal ganglia associated with learning and motor function. Previous studies have also shown that the striatum is necessary for normal timing behavior. To address how striatal signals might be involved in timing, we recorded from striatal neurons in rats performing an interval timing task. We found that neurons fired at delays spanning tens of seconds and that this pattern of responding reflected the interaction between time and the animals’ ongoing sensorimotor state. Surprisingly, cells rescaled responses in time when intervals changed, indicating that striatal populations encoded relative time. Moreover, time estimates decoded from activity predicted timing behavior as animals adjusted to new intervals, and disrupting striatal function led to a decrease in timing performance. These results suggest that striatal activity forms a scalable population code for time, providing timing signals that animals use to guide their actions.

> 	In Brief Time is fundamental for all behavior, yet how the brain encodes time is unknown. Mello, Soares, and Paton found that firing dynamics in populations of neurons in the rodent striatum robustly and flexibly encoded time over tens of seconds. These results supply new insight into how the basal ganglia might function during learning and action selection.

> 	Multiple lines of evidence implicate the basal ganglia (BG) as a locus for the representation of such temporal information. Lesions of the striatum in rats [2], disease states that affect the BG such as Parkinson’s [3] and Huntington’s disease [4], drugs that affect dopamine (DA) signaling [5], and genetic manipulations that affect the DA system in the BG [6] all result in interval timing dysfunction. Furthermore, human fMRI studies have found that the striatum, a main input area of the BG, is activated by tasks that involve the processing of interval information [7, 8].

> 	Strikingly, we found that temporal tuning stretched or contracted, rescaling with the interval being timed. Thus, striatal populations encoded relative time, flexibly adapting to the immediate demands of the environment. Finally, we ran a simple simulation of the task and show that neural responses resembling those we observe in the striatum are suitable as a basis for timing behavior.

> 	Briefly, rats were placed in a behavioral box containing a lever positioned over a liquid delivery port and were trained to press the lever to receive water reward. Reward delivery triggered a timer, and reward became available again only after the timer exceeded a FI ranging from 12 s to 60 s in multiples of 12 s. Lever presses occurring after reward delivery but before the FI had elapsed were not reinforced. A FI was maintained for between 18 and 40 rewards before changing to another FI, randomly chosen from the interval set

Some cells fired just after reward delivery, others fired in the middle of the delay, and others fired leading up to the next reward (Figures 2A, S2, and S3). This produced a slow-moving ‘‘bump’’ of activity that traversed the population during each FI.

Thus, the bump in activity within the striatum population moved progressively slower as the FI wore on. Strikingly, the overall time taken by this bump to traverse the population appeared to scale with the FI (Figures 2A and S4A)

The responses of these neurons can be observed in Figure 2A, wherein the position of cells along the y axis is the same across the panels displaying average responses in each of the FIs (for all recorded cells, see Figure S4A).

In each of the first seven trials of a block, we counted spikes within defined time bins and asked how likely we were to have observed that number of spikes at each time given the observed distributions of spike counts in trials 8 onward of the corresponding block.

A dominant view supported by a wide range of neurobiological data posits that the BG implements aspects of reinforcement learning (RL) [1, 20, 25–28], learning how an organism ought to act in order to maximize reward. However, to learn about the sometimes-delayed consequences of actions and to guide future behavior toward rewarding outcomes, it is absolutely necessary that the brain represent situations and actions through time [1, 29].

> 	Indeed, temporal relations among actions and events contain the causal information that learning systems have evolved to detect through a process sometimes referred to as credit assignment [30]. Once credit for the occurrence of predictable events has been assigned, this information must be used to profitably guide the course and timing of action as situations arise. This continuous learning-behaving cycle is what RL algorithms naturally account for [29]. Yet, it is not known how the BG, the brain system most often associated with RL, represents temporal relationships over the durations necessary to explain its purported role in animal learning and behavior

> 	The sequential neural states that we describe in the striatum during timing behavior can provide a unifying view of the BG’s role in timing and RL. These signals are strikingly similar to temporal basis functions proposed in existing learning models as more neurally plausible and efficient representations of time [21–23], which we show can be used to generate timing behavior similar to what we observed experimentally. Such models operate by learning a set of weights used in a weighted sum of the temporal bases to construct a moment-by-moment prediction about future events such as expected reward. In theory, a weighted combination of activity patterns in the cortical or thalamic inputs to the striatum could act as such temporal bases and modulate the responses of striatal neurons that we observed

> 	Our data appear most consistent with theoretical models that suggest distributed representations of time encoded by the joint activity of populations of neurons [13]. Indeed, the decoder used in the current study assumes that time information may be present in many different neurons. However, we cannot rule out that upstream of the population we recorded in the striatum, other forms of temporal representations may exist. For instance, an accumulating process such as that contained within pacemaker accumulator models [9] might act to trigger neurons to become active at different delays as the accumulator passes a series of thresholds.
